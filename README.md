# CheesyMotionPlanning

Based on the cheesy poof's 2017 code.

You will want to update this when their 2018 code is released.

What you have to implement: motor controllers, and PIDF loops for velocity. (see their code, especially once their 2018 code is released.)

What else you have to do: define the paths that you want to use.

See their code for what gains need to be configured.

Also configure the numbers in the Constants file.
